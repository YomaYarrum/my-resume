<p>“To be a champion, compete; to be a great champion, compete with the best; but to be the greatest champion, compete with yourself.”― Matshona Dhliwayo</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My name is Amoy Murray. I have been designing for the last three years. I fell in love with it after working as a CARE represenative at Vistaprint for the last
      10 years. You can say I have been in it for that long, however, I started taking it seriously three years ago. I love working with businesses and brands and I hope to not only create small projects but prjects that can help these brands grow beautifully.</p>
